'''
The Rotary club has planned to organize several events on the Womenâ€™s day. The volunteers are given a list of activities and the starting time and ending time of those activities.
Write a python function which accepts the activity list, start_time list and finish_time list. The function should find out and return the list of maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person.
Assume that a person can work only on a single activity at a time. If an activity performed by a person ends at x unit time then he/she can take up the next activity which is starting at any time greater than or equal to x+1.

Refer table below for sample input and expected output:
